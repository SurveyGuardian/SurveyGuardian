@article{Shamon.2020,
 abstract = {In this paper, we examine rates of careless responding and reactions towards detection methods (i.e., attention check item and instruction) in an experimental setting based on two different samples. First, we use a quota sample (with monetary incentive), a central data source for internet-based surveys in sociological and political research. Second, we include a voluntary opt-in panel (without monetary incentive) well suited to conduct survey experiments (e.g., factorial surveys). Respondents' reactions towards the detection items are analyzed by objective, non-reactive indicators (i.e., break-off, item nonresponse, and measurement quality), and two self-report scales. Our reaction analyses reveal that the detection methods that we applied are not only well suited to identify careless respondents but also exert a motivational rather than demotivating influence on respondents' answer behavior and, hence, contribute to data quality.},

@article{Maniaci.2014,
 abstract = {The current studies examined the adverse effects of inattentive responding on compliance with study tasks, data quality, correlational analyses, experimental manipulations, and statistical power. Results suggested that 3--9{\%} of respondents engaged in highly inattentive responding, forming latent classes consistent with prior work that converged across existing indices (e.g., long-string index, multivariate outliers, even--odd consistency, psychometric synonyms and antonyms) and new measures of inattention (the Attentive Responding Scale and the Directed Questions Scale). Inattentive respondents provided self-report data of markedly poorer quality, sufficient to obscure meaningful regression results as well as the effects of experimental manipulations. Screening out inattentive respondents improved statistical power, helping to mitigate the notable drops in power and estimated effect sizes caused by inattention.},
